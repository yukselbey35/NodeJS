Our program caters to students who seek to blend their computer science abilities with a natural science focus.While a degree in the field will certainly prepare you for your career, the learning doesn’t stop once you have your diploma in hand. It’s important that programmers stay curious and continue taking the initiative to keep learning throughout their career.The world of technology is ever shifting, and new trends and information are being produced on the tech front every day. Not only are computer programmers continually learning how things work and how to properly put the pieces together, but programming language and code, as well as technologies and tools, are constantly evolving.</p>

					<h1>How Much Do Web Developers Make? And 5 Other Questions About This Coding Career</h1>
					 
<p> Every day, millions of people across the globe visit websites dedicated to nearly any topic you think of. These sites serve as digital storefronts, forums for discussion and centralized hubs for news and events that have a massive influence on our lives. Needless to say, websites are a pretty big deal. </p>

<h2>1.How much do web developers actually make? </h2>
<p><img id="left_pic" src= "img/rightside1.jpg"/>Earning potential is almost always a top priority for those who are considering career options—fortunately things look strong in that department for web developers. The 2017 median annual wage for web developers is $67,990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The lowest 10 percent of web developers earn less than $36,830, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $122,320.1 
Additionally, the BLS projects employment of web developers to grow 15 percent between 2016 and 2026, faster than the average for all other occupations.1 Of course, a lot of variables like location and experience can influence your earning potential as a web developer. Heather Weaver, a freelance web developer and marketer, has found the biggest determining factor for earning potential is often your range of expertise.
“The more value you can bring, the more you get paid,” Weaver says. </p>

<h2>2.What are some typical web developer job duties? </h2>
<p><img id="right_pic" src="img/rightside2.jpg"  />Web developers cover a lot of ground when it comes to technical know-how and sometimes are divided into distinct positions, particularly those who work for larger organizations. There are two primary types of web developers—front-end and back-end. Those who can (mostly) do it all are sometimes called “full-stack” developers. These developers may be especially appealing to smaller organizations with limited development stuff budgets. General duties for all these types of positions include: 
Meeting with clients or company management to discuss website needs and design 
Creating and testing website applications 
Writing code using programming languages like HTML and XML
Integrating graphics, video and audio 
Working with other designers to determine the website’s layout 
Monitoring website traffic 
Back-end developers are the behind-the-scenes crew of any website. Their work is primarily focused on writing and editing code that allows sites to communicate with servers and function properly. Front-end developers focus their work primarily on the appearance and layout of information on a site. 
It’s becoming more and more common for developers to develop a mix of front-end and back-end skills, though it’s not always easy. Colton De Vos, web developer at Resolute Technology Solutions, says it may be more difficult to go from front-end to back-end if you don’t have a deeper programming and coding background. 
For a more in-depth breakdown of the differences between front-end and back-end developers, check out our article, “Front-End vs. Back-End Development: Which Side of the Screen Are You?”

<h2>3.What are the must-have web developer skills? </h2>
<p><img id="mid_pic" src= "img/rightside3.jpg"/>Being a web developer means learning new skills frequently as web design changes and more and more tools become available. So what technical skills are in-demand? We analyzed over 154,000 web developer job postings to identify some of the most commonly sought-after skills. Here’s what we found:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Java™</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>SQL</li>
</ul>
<h2>4.What qualities are needed to be a great web developer? </h2>

<p>Aside from learning the technical programming and coding languages, the best web developers possess characteristics and qualities that lead them to success. You might already have these and if so, becoming a web developer might be the perfect fit! 
Persistence in problem-solving: Building a website doesn’t always go smoothly and troubleshooting issues can take time to resolve—but the best developers embrace the challenge. 
Creativity: Developers must be able to design websites that are both functional and appealing, while also using their creativity to problem-solve any glitches or find solutions to the client’s or management’s requests. 
Customer service and communication skills: Web developers often interact with internal and external stakeholders and need to be able to effectively explain their work. 
Detail-oriented: A minor error in coding can derail an entire website, so web developers have to be diligent even when proofing their own work. 
As in many jobs, excellent communication is key. You may think of web development as a solitary career, but Joshua Holmes, CEO of Ethode, says the days where developers could plug away at their work in cubicles and never talk to people is over. Sharing your ideas and opinions is crucial, as is listening to the needs of your clients or management. 
“Great problem-solving starts with great listening,” Holmes says.
